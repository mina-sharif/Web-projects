          <h3>Design and Development</h3>
          <p>
            I can proudly say that I have gained a lot skills by studying IT. 
            I have studied finance but I have always been very interested design, 
            and when I find out that I could use this interest by learning web development. 
            I have finally found my passion. Because in web development or 
            IT there is always something new to learn and not only develop websites but develop myself as the same time. 
            Learning new languages fast is one of my skills.

          <h3>I love oil painting and design.</h3>
          <p> 
            Since I was little I have been interested in paintings and the kind of art I paint is abstract art paintings. 
            It is because this art allows everyone to have their on meanings. 
            “Art is not what you see, but what you make others to see.” And i love sushi!
